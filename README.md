# IMAGE-STEGANOGRAPY
The messages which are to be kept private and to be transmitted without getting
interpreted by the attacker is really a challenging task. For instance, the secret
information which is very important for trading between nations should not be
compromised in any case. Steganography helps to transmit the message by
getting embedded in the image, audio or video file. The algorithm and its
effectiveness plays a vital role in preventing the embedded message from being
hacked. This project report contains the implementation of image steganography
using traditional lsb algorithm, adaptive lsb algorithm, filtered lsb algorithm and
the novel approach called as advanced filtered algorithm. The advanced filtered
algorithm helps to minimize the disadvantages available in other mentioned
algorithms. The mean square is the matric considered to measure the error
between the cover(original) image and the stego image(image with message bit).
